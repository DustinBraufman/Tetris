<div class="text">
    <p>  Keep it flat: Aiming to keep your playing field flat makes it easier to avoid creating empty columns. This technique can be difficult sometimes as it can be very dependent on the order of pieces and over committing to it can distract from more paramount problems and goals.

            The Soft Drop:
            Letting the tetris piece fall can allow you to maneuver the piece into spaces that would be inaccessible when you force drop them. This strategy helps set up winning structures and can prevent you from creating unwanted crevices.</p>

      Wait for the I-Piece: You build up a mountain of blocks with a one block long cavity all the way to the ground. Once an I-piece is available you send it down into the whole for a “tetris”(when you delete four lines at once). This strategy is more effective than randomly placing blocks, and typically scores more points.</p>

            T-Spins: A fan favorite, it is a type of soft-dropping where you maneuver the upside down t shaped tetromino into odd spaces by rotating it last second. It can help eliminate some odd landscapes and often counts for more points in modern versions of the game. </p>
